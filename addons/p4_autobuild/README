Overview
--------

Three main concepts:
* Watch - a description of a perforce view to watch
* Subscriber - someone interesting in knowing the results of the build
* Change - a description of a perforce change

schedule.py is run regularly (nightly) to schedule builds for the new changes.

ovt_bridge.py runs regularly and submits overtest testruns for each scheduled change, waits for the results, and notifies subscribers.
